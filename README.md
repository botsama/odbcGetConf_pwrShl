# odbcGetConf_pwrShl
Checks server for x64 and x32 ODBC configurations

This is especially helpful for applications with a database connection to another server or potentially local as well.

As my standard method, .cmd is the command prompt call to load powershell and ignore execution policy restrictions.

If results are blank, there should be no ODBC configs.
Can confirm in desktop GUI from Control Panel | Administration Tools
